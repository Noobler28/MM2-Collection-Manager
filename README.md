Hey im connor a small developer who plays roblox. Specifically MM2.
As a collector i always struggled to keep track of what i have, need, how many i have, without a reliable way to check.
Thats why i created this small project, for me and other collectors alike.

# Collection
The items are displayed as followed:
| Weapon Name | COLL/UNCOL | Count | Rarity | Estimated Value |

### Catagories, Subcatagories and the Search bar 
The weapons are split into catagories and subcatagories, for example; MysteryBoxes / MysteryBox1 | Events / Halloween2013 | Godlies / Chromas.
You can open the catagories and subcatagories yourself using the dropdowns, if you know where an item will be located.
However, if you dont know where an item is, you can always use the search bar. Search for a term using the search, for example; Candy.
and it will find every item found inside the weapons list, that has the word candy; Candycane, Candycorn, Candy, ETC. 
But dont worry you can flick through them and it will open to the Correct catagories and subcatagories for you, and even highlight the correct item
### Status 
You can toggle the Status of an item with the click of a button; Uncollected / Collected
### Count
You can enter the count of an item easily, by changing the value inside the box and clicking enter
### Color Co-ordination
All items are color co-ordinated, making it easy to tell what rarity it is!
## Auto Scanning
Enable a setting to allow auto scanning, This setting will scan your MM2 inventory and automatically add the items into the tracker for you.
Dont worry this isnt needed, its just for the ease of it.
There are 2 options you can take with this; 
RealTime - You enable auto scan and open your Inventory on MM2, it will monitor your screen and with image recognition, add the items to the collection
ScreenShots - You can take screenshots of your inventory and input them into the auto scan, this will do the same as option 1 and add the items to the collection



# Tracker
Input the items you gave and recieved into the respective boxes and click the button to add the trade to the tracker
The tracker is saved to .JSON file so any time you open the script (ASLONG AS U DONT DELETE THE .JSON) will be saved and loaded
### W/F/L
The tracker displays if a trade is a WIN, FAIR, or LOSS, based on the estimated values of the weapons
### Selecting Trade
Select a trade in the tracker to delete it, or for more information about the trade
You can input the information yourself, like any notes about the trade, the other traders username, etc
### Auto Scanning
Just like with the collection manager you can automatically scan your trades into the trading tracker.
